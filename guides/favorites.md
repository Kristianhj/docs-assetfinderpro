# Favorites

When in the favorites pane, you are able to see all the assets and folders you have added to your favorites. The list is searchable and can be restricted by type. Each individual asset has a small thumbnail image that allows you to get an overview. You can also have folders marked as favorites, if that fits your workflow better.

## Adding new favorite
There are two ways of adding new favorites to your list:
* (Shortcut key) Select a prefab in the hierarchy window, or any asset in the project window and the pressing `Ctrl + T`
* (Context menu) Right click the asset and choose `Favorites PRO -> Add asset to favorites`
