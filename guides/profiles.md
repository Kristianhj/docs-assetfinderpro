# Profiles

The Profiles window allows you to create/remove profiles, copy values from other profiles and change active profile. By default, there should be no need to create any new profiles, as the tools automatically creates one for you by using your current windows/mac user. Sometimes however you might want to create department specific profiles such as DEP_EnvironmentArt or DEP_LevelDesign which allows you to share favorites for multiple team members.
