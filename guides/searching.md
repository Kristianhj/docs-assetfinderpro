# Searching Favorites

The search bar allows you to search your favorites in a convenient way.
By pressing the little magnifying glass, you will be able to choose which asset types you want to search.
Whatever you write in the search bar will search all assets in your favorites list. It searches through Asset name, Asset path and Asset type.
