It allows you to store and search your favorites, while also maintaining a detailed history of your actions, allowing you to find assets youâ€™ve recently used.

## Who is this for?

* Would you like to speed up level building?

* Do you sometimes have a hard time finding the asset/script file you are looking for?

* Do you have a number of assets it would be great to have at the tip of your fingers?

If any of the above applies, then Asset Finder PRO is the tool for you!

## What does it do?
Asset Finder PRO is a tool that will ease your daily workflow building content and levels. This is done in 3 distinct ways:

* A comprehensive automatic history of all the assets you have been using recently, which allows you to quickly find the things you use the most.

* A list of your own favorites for easy access (Both folders and individual assets)

* A list of all the prefabs being used in current scene. That allows you to quickly find anything often used in a specific scene.

These 3 methods will allow you to speed up your level building and content creation, and not spend time searching through obscure folders to find the assets you need.

## Does it support multiple users?
Asset Finder PRO is built to support multi-user development, automatically creating custom favorites for each team member, while also supporting a painless version control workflow.
You are also able to copy favorites from other profiles, allowing for shared profiles that multiple team members can benefit from.
